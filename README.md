# Sadaora Starter App

This is a full-stack starter project built with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express, TypeScript, Prisma)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for image uploads

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sadaora-starter.git
cd sadaora-starter
```

### 2. Setup environment variables

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and replace with:

[Open access to keys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ildTwjn5tYqewc9GUYIZDCc7hebDqt3yM7ygo3u-vgo/edit?usp=drive_link)

## üê≥ Running with Docker

Start the backend and database:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Start a PostgreSQL database
- Start the backend on port `4000`

---

## üíª Running the Frontend
> ‚ö†Ô∏è The frontend is designed to run in Docker as well, but due to an issue with Docker and Next.js, it's currently run manually instead.
### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Credentials for two users

```bash
email address: john@example.com or luisa@example.com
pass: password123
```

App will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üß™ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express, Prisma, JWT
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud**: AWS S3

### üìà Startup Environment Justification

In a startup setting, speed, clarity, and scalability are crucial. My choices reflect these values:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Keeping frontend and backend in the same repository simplifies onboarding and aligns with the lean nature of startups‚Äîdevelopers can move quickly without managing multiple repos.

- **Docker for Local Dev**: Docker ensures environment consistency across all machines, so new team members can spin up the app in one command‚Äîthis removes friction and accelerates iteration.

- **Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL**: Prisma provides rapid development with type safety and intuitive syntax, while PostgreSQL offers a battle-tested, scalable solution fit for production workloads.

- **JWT Authentication**: Lightweight and scalable, JWT tokens allow the backend to stay stateless‚Äîperfect for future horizontal scaling without needing session stores.

- **S3 Photo Uploads**: Offloading image storage to AWS S3 keeps the app performant and lets us focus on core features, not managing binary files on our server.
